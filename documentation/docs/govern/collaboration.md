Collab functionality enables you to discuss code and documentation easily with the stakeholders via VSCode and UI. Many stakeholders are not comfortable using IDE directly; this functionality enables them also to have a discussion with technical users.

## Code Collaboration Workflow

/// admonition | Code Collaboration workflow allows you to discuss code without creating a PR
type: tip
///

### Start a discussion

You can start a discussion at the file or code block levels (single or multiple lines) by pressing (+) sign next to the code.

![StartDiscussion](images/startDiscussion.png)<br>

/// admonition | If you click on the display icon as shown in the image above, you can show details of the discussion previously started
type: tip
///

When a discussion is started, the extension generates dbt docs and uploads those docs to the Altimate AI SaaS instance so that non-technical stakeholders can contribute to the discussion via SaaS UI as well.

### Add a comment

Once the discussion is started, you can publish a comment and also tag other users from the Altimate AI SaaS instance.

/// admonition | If you don't want to tag the user but still want to share the link with them, just copy the link from the comments box, and share it with them manually (Slack, Email etc.)
type: tip
///

### Email notification (if a user is tagged)

Tagger user receives an email notification with a link to open the discussion in the Altimate AI UI.

### Technical user can see the comment in IDE directly

The technical user who started the discussion in IDE can see the replies from other users directly in the IDE.

The discussion can continue from here onwards or it can be resolved by clicking resolve action available on top of the comment textbox. Discussion can be started from a UI also
similarly, by clicking on (+) sign next to the code blocks.

## Document Collaboration Workflow

Table and column descriptions can also be reviewed and discussed with this functionality.

### Start a discussion

Discussion can be started via VSCode in the Documentation Editor panel or from SaaS product UI also from the link shared as covered in code collaboration workflow above.

### Export lineage

You can export model-level and column-level lineage. Just click the export button at the top of the panel and give the export a name.
