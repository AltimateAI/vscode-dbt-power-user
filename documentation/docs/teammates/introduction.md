## What are AI Teammates?

As AI is evolving, now we can create virtual AI teammates where some pieces of work can be done autonomously by them. You can coach these virtual teammates just like new members of your team, so the work they deliver is perfectly tailored for your organizations requirements.

## What work AI Teammates can Do?

In certain scenarios, they can assist you vs. doing work completely autonomously and you can personalize these assistants as per your requirements. Today, work done by data teams can be divided in three simple buckets - 1. Done by humans 2. Done by humans and AI together 3. Done by AI autnomously
