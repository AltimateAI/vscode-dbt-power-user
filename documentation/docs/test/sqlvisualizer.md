# SQL Visualizer (Beta)

The new SQL visualizer translates complex SQL queries into intuitive graphical representations. SQL visualizer functionality shows the SQL structure of your code and how different components of the code are connected.
The provided SQL query is visually broken down into nodes representing CTEs, joins, filters, and unions, making it easier to understand, refactor, and debug the query components.

### Key Benefits

- Enhanced Comprehension: Quickly grasp SQL structure and flow through visual elements.
- Improved Productivity: Drag-and-drop functionality for faster query modification.
- Better Collaboration: Visual diagrams are effective documentation and are easier to share.
- Easier Refactoring: Simplify query restructuring with the visual graph of all components.
- Simplified Debugging: Identify and correct errors quickly by visually tracing query logic.
