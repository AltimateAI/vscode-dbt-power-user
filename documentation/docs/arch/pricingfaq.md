### 3. **What is considered an upgrade or downgrade of the subscription?**

Upgrade or downgrade of the subscription is determined based on the price of the subscription plan. If the price of the original subscription plan is higher than the price of the newer subscription plan, it's considered a downgrade. If the price of the original subscription plan is lower than the price of the new subscription plan, it's considered an upgrade.

### 4. **What happens during an upgrade of the subscription?**

As soon as you upgrade the subscription, changes will be made to your instance for the new subscription. You will be charged the difference between a new subscription price and the prorated current subscription price based on the no. of credits remaining.

### 5. **What happens during a downgrade of the subscription?**

Your current subscription will be downgraded at the end of the current billing cycle. There is no refund when you downgrade your subscription, as the subscription is downgraded at the end of the billing cycle.

### 6. **What happens if I change from a yearly subscription to a monthly subscription?**

If the price of the monthly subscription is lower than the yearly subscription, it's considered a downgrade. So, the change in the subscription will be made only after the current billing period is over.

If you would like to make an immediate change to your subscription, make the change at a yearly plan level. It will be considered an upgrade and will be effective immediately.
