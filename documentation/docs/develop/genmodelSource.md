Generating model from sources defined in yaml file is very easy as below:

![Generate model from source](images/generateModelSource.gif)

/// details | You can configure a file name template and prefix in the extension settings

![Generate model settings](images/genModelSettings.png)

///

/// admonition | Why does the generated model appear with the syntax {{ adapter.quote(column_name)}}?
type: info

This syntax provides a safe way for the adapter to quote the columns.
Since the extension supports different adapters, this is the easiest way to ensure that it works for all of them.
