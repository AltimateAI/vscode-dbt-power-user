Query explanation is invaluable to understanding a complex piece of dbt or SQL code (especially written by others!).

## Start Query Explanation

You can get an explanation for the entire query code in the file or selected parts. If you need an explanation for only some part of the code, select that code first. You can trigger the query explanation functionality in three different ways.

### Right Click Menu #Right-click, select "DataPilot" menu, and choose an action to "explain" the query.<br>

## Get more details in the DataPilot chat

Once you start the query explanation workflow in the DataPilot chat panel on the left-hand side, DataPilot will show more specific suggestions to get detailed explanations on specific areas. You can choose one of those suggestions or ask more questions in the input box below the suggestions, as shown in the image below.
