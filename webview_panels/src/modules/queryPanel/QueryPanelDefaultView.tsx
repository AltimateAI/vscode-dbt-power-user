            We&apos;re excited to announce that soon, you&apos;ll be able to
            execute dbt SQL directly within notebooks. This new feature will
            empower you to create data-driven stories, streamline debugging
            processes, and optimize your workflowsâ€”all within VSCode. Stay tuned
            for more updates and{" "}

            Execute any SQL query with the &quot;+ New Query&quot; button. Every
            query you run in the current VSCode session is stored in your query
            history, accessible for later use.
            <br />
            Bookmark your favorite or frequently used queries for easy access
            and share them with your team.
            <br />
            You can also rerun queries directly from your history or bookmarks.
