You can write descriptions for dbt models and columns.

For columns that are not referenced in the dbt model, you can click “sync with db” button to get those columns shown in the documentation editor as well.

Documentatione editor also shows the descriptions that were already present. You can update existing documentation if needed as well.

In the end, you can save the documentation to the existing or a new YAML file in the directory.
